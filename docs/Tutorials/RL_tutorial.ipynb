    "This repo is one part of a project pipeline, which requires the coordination of multiple repos. Projects begin with a <b>task repo</b>, which is used to collect behavioural data from participants either locally or on Prolific. The collected data must then be pushed through a <b>data extraction repo</b> to prepare CSV files for analysis. These CSV files are used in <b>the analysis repo</b>, which creates a PDF report (`AL/reports`), ending the project pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can run computational reinforcement learning models using the <b>modelling repo (this repo)</b>, and the results can be added to the report. This is a bit clunky because it requires a bit of back-and-forth between the analysis repo and this modelling repo. Specifically, the analysis repo must be run (with `load_models=False`) in order to create two CSV files that this repo needs (`AL/data/pain_learning_processed.csv` and `AL/data/pain_transfer_processed.csv`). These files can then be manually moved into this repo's data directory (`RL/data`). This repo can then be used to model the data, which will result in a newly constructed directory called `modelling` (`RL/modelling`). This folder can then be manually moved to the analysis repo as `AL/modelling`. Then you can re-run the analysis repo (with `load_models=True`) and the modelling results will be included in the PDF report. "

    "## Validating Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will be looking at how to validate your models. In practice, it is best to do this before the fitting procedure we have just outlined above. Model validation ensures that your model is functioning as intended and that the model parameters (e.g., the upper and lower bounds) are appropriate for your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the validation mode requires a `recovery` parameter and this parameter indicates whether you are conducting `parameter` or `model` recovery. Parameter recovery is the process of generating data with known parameters for a given model, and then fitting that data with the same model to determine whether the parameters are recoverable. Model recovery is the process of generating data with known parameters for all given models. Each model is then fitted to all generated data (regardless of which model generated it) to test which model best fits data from every model. Ideally, the model that generated the data should be the best fit for the corresponding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will next define some typical parameters to use in these validations. We are also included an optional `bounds` parameter below. This parameter should be a nested dictionary where the highest level are model base names (i.e., without optional parameters such as `novel`) and the lowest level are parameter bounds to be overwritten. Bounds are used to constrain are parameters during fitting (and during generating data) in that the indicated parameters will not leave the bounds. Below, we are only constraining `temperature` for all models, because if this value is too large then the model converges towards responding randomly, and thus all other paramaters are ignored (thus unrecoverable). Any bounds that are not overwritten in this way will be determined by their defaults, which are declared in the `RLModel` class (`RL/models/rl_models.py`)."

The main result we are interested in is which model best fit each dataset (again the different datasets correspond to data generated by different models). A successful model recovery would demonstrate that each model best fit it's own generated data. We can view this in a confusion matrix below. The BIC values are used here, and they are normalized to range between -100 and 100. So, -100 was the worst fit across all analyses and 100 was the best fit across analyses."

    "Again, a `fit_data` file was built during this validation, `fit_data_MODEL.fit`, and we can look into that as well. Just like the other fit datasets, it is a dictionary with model names as keys and dataframes as values for those keys. The dataframes are slightly different than before, however, in that they now include a new column called `model`. This indicates which model generated the data being fit. You can think of this as the dictionary key being the model fitting the data and the model column in the dataframe as the model that generated the data when being fit."
