    "## Project Pipeline\n",
    "This repo is one part of a project pipeline, which requires the coordination of multiple repos. Projects begin with a <b>task repo</b>, which is used to collect behavioural data from participants either locally or on Prolific. The collected data must then be pushed through a <b>data extraction repo</b> to prepare CSV files for analysis. These CSV files are used in <b>the analysis repo</b>, which creates a PDF report (`AL/reports`), ending the project pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can run computational reinforcement learning models using the <b>modelling repo (this repo)</b>, and the results can be added to the report. This is a bit clunky because it requires a bit of back-and-forth between the analysis repo and this modelling repo. Specifically, the analysis repo must be run (with `load_models=False`) in order to create two CSV files that this repo needs (`AL/data/pain_learning_processed.csv` and `AL/data/pain_transfer_processed.csv`). These files can then be manually moved into this repo's data directory (`RL/data`). This repo can then be used to model the data, which will result in a newly constructed directory called `modelling` (`RL/modelling`). This folder can then be manually moved to the analysis repo as `AL/modelling`. Then you can re-run the analysis repo (with `load_models=True`) and the modelling results will be included in the PDF report. "
